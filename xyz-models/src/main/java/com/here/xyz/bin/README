Binary model classes have to be re-generated when the schemas get changed.
Schemas can be found under src/main/resources/*.fbs

Please make sure that the "flatbuffers" compiler is installed on your system:
On debian systems e.g., it can be installed like: `apt install flatbuffers`
The binary schema classes can be generated from their schemas using the following call:

cd xyz-models
./buildSchemas
