            Additional space filter which compares the space's contentUpdatedAt timestamp with the one
            specified in the query, resulting in a subset of spaces.
    
    
            The usage of a comma (,) separating the timestamps, represents
            an OR operation.

    
            The format should follow the specification below
              * ?contentUpdatedAt=timestamp
    
            While in the following example
              * ?contentUpdatedAt=timestamp_1,timestamp_2
    
    
            The resulting spaces list will contain all contentUpdatedAt having timestamp_1 OR timestamp_2
    
            
            The available operators are:
              - "=" - equals
              - "!=" - not equals
              - ">=" or "=gte=" - greater than or equals
              - "<=" or "=lte=" - less than or equals
              - ">" or "=gt=" - greater than

      description: Create or patch features.
      x-experimental-description: >
        This method allows to create, update and delete features. The behavior
        of the POST handler is controlled by three query parameters described in
        detail below. The name of the parameter reflects a condition to be
        matched. Its value reflects the corresponding action to be performed for
        this case.


        If no values are provided, the request is handled with the default
        values:


        ```


        ne=create&e=patch&transactional=true


        ```


        The three parameters and their possible values are:


        ### _ne_ - If Not Exists


        If no feature with the provided ID exists, or if the provided feature
        contains no ID, then one of the following actions can be used:


        * __create__  (default) - A new object is created.


        * __retain__ - No action is executed, allowing the execution of the
        batch operation to continue, even if the _transactional_ parameter is
        set to _true_.


        * __error__ - If no object with the provided ID exists, an error is
        raised, which would result in the whole batch operation to be aborted,
        if the _transactional_ parameter is set to _true_.


        ### _e_ - If Exists


        If an object with the provided ID exists, and _history_ is enabled for
        the space, there are 2 states which could be taken into account:

            1. The __ORIGIN__ state - the state that the client received and modified. The state is retrieved by using the value of the root attribute _guid_.

            2. The __HEAD__ state - the current state of the object in the space, including any changes applied to it in the meantime.


        The possible operations in detail:


        * __patch__  (default) - The feature object is handled as a _partial
        update object_. Therefore it could contain only the properties, which
        should be modified. Properties, which do not exist in the HEAD state of
        the object are inserted, the values for all existing properties are
        updated, unless the value of the property is set to _null_ , which will
        result in the property being removed from the object.

            If an _ORIGIN_ state is specified in the _partial update object_ and it is not the same as the _HEAD_ state, the patch is applied to the _HEAD_ state, but only in case that the differnce between _ORIGIN_ and _HEAD_ contains no conflicting changes( i.e. only different properties were modified ). Otherwise an error is raised, which will result in the batch operation being aborted, if the _transactional_ parameter is set to _true_.

        * __replace__ - If an object with the provided ID exists, it will be
        replaced with the provided feature object. If the _ORIGIN_ state is
        specified in the provided feature and differs from the _HEAD_ state,
        then a error is raised.


        * __merge__ - The provided feature object is handled as a full object
        version and not a partial update. If an _ORIGIN_ state is specified in
        the feature and it is not the same as the _HEAD_ state, the difference
        between the _ORIGIN_ state and provided version to the _HEAD_ state, but
        only in the case that the differnce between _ORIGIN_ and _HEAD_ contains
        no conflicting changes. Otherwise an error is raised, which will result
        in the batch operation being aborted, if the _transactional_ parameter
        is set to _true_.


        * __delete__ - The feature with the provided is deleted.


        * __retain__ - The current state of the feature is retained and included
        in the response.


        * __error__ - Raises an error, if the object already exists.


        ### transactional - Transactional batch operation


        Defines, if modifying of the features, is executed as a single
        transactional batch operation (_true_:default) or as independent
        operations (_false_).

    Clustering:
      name: clustering
      in: query
      description: >-
        The clustering algorithm to apply to the data within the result.
        Providing this query parameter the data will be returned in a clustered way.
        This means the data won't necessarily be returned in its original shape or with its
        original properties.

        Depending on the chosen clustering algorithm there could be different mandatory and/or
        optional parameters to specify the behavior of the algorithm.

        Possible values are:

          * "hexbin"

            The hexbin algorithm divides the world in hexagonal "bins" on a specified resolution.
            Each hexagon has an address being described by the H3 addressing scheme.
            For more information on that topic see: https://eng.uber.com/h3/

          * "quadbin"

            The quadbin algorithm takes the geometry input from the request (e.g. quadkey / bbox..)
            and count the features in it. This clustering mode works also for very large spaces and
            can be used for getting an overview where data is present in a given space. Furthermore,
            a property filter on one property is applicable.

        Some parameters for the chosen clustering algorithm.

        Depending on the chosen clustering algorithm there could be different mandatory and/or
        optional parameters to specify the behavior of the algorithm.

        ### Clustering-Parameter reference

        NOTE: The actual query parameters in the URL are looking like: `?clustering.aParameterName=aValue`

        **Clustering-type: "hexbin":**

        There are several parameters needed by the H3 based hexbin algorithm.
        For more information on that topic see: https://eng.uber.com/h3/

        | Parameter   | Type    | Mandatory | Meaning                                                               |

        | property    | String  | NO        | A property of the original features for which to calculate statistics |
        | pointmode   | Boolean | NO        | retuns the centroid of hexagons as geojson feature                    |


        **Clustering-type: "quadbin":**

        There are several parameters needed by the quadbin algorithm. You can use one property filter in combination.

        | Parameter   | Type    | Mandatory | Meaning                                                               |

        | noBuffer    | Boolean | NO        | do not place a buffer around quad polygons, default: false            |
        | resolution  | Number  | NO        | deprecated, renamed to resolutionRelative             |
        | countmode   | String  | NO        | [real, estimated, mixed]                                    |
        |             |         |           | real = real feature counts. Best accuracy, but slow.                  |

        Additional feature filters which compares the feature's property's value with the one
        specified in the query, resulting in a subset of features.


        The usage of multiple property names represents an AND operation.
        The usage of a comma (,) separating the properties values, represents
        an OR operation.


        The format should follow the specification below
          * ?p.property_name_1=property_value_1&f.special_property_name_1=special_property_value_1


        For example, the above query, the Features will be filtered by
        'property' AND 'special property' equals to their respective values.


        While in the following example
          * ?p.property_name_1=value_1,value_2


        The resulting Features list will contain all elements having value_1 OR value_2

        The available operators are:
          - "=" - equals
          - "!=" - not equals
          - ">=" or "=gte=" - greater than or equals
          - "<=" or "=lte=" - less than or equals
          - ">" or "=gt=" - greater than
          - "<" or "=lt=" - less than
