   * Returning <code>true</code> means, that this compilation interceptor should be chosen by the root job compiler
   * to perform the actual compilation for the specified job. In that case the job compiler will call
   * the method {@link #compile(Job)} one or multiple times afterwards.
   *
   * Taking the decision on whether this interceptor is responsible for the job's compilation should be
   * done on the basis of the information being provided within the job's source & target definitions.
   * These definitions can be retrieved from the job directly using the methods:
   * - {@link Job#getSource()}
   * - {@link Job#getTarget()}
   * The needed information is primarily the type of the source / target objects and their according settings parameters.
   *
   * NOTE: Within the whole framework, there might be always only *one* compilation interceptor that may be responsible
   * for compiling a specific job. That means the implementation of this method *must* assure return <code>false</code>
   * for all cases in which it is not responsible for the specified job. Otherwise, the job will fail with a {@link CompilationError}.
