## Naksha_2.2.13
- Local testing support for extensions.

## Naksha_2.2.12
- Geo-hash is now generated directly from the geometry instead of centroid.
- This fixes the error "Geohash requires inputs in decimal degrees" that occurred when using the centroid.

## Naksha_2.1.5

- Fixed thread hanging issue fixed by avoiding indefinite locking in `FibLinearProbeTable.java`

## Naksha_2.1.4

- Fixes:
  - Patch API (POST /features) fixed to `replace` entire array instead of `append` nodes during patch operation, which otherwise prevents removal of the node even-though is desired 


## Naksha_1.1.1

- Fixes:
  - PGSQL triggers fixed to handle missing `rtcts` and `version` fields for existing data migrated to newly created Naksha spaces
  - `xyz` namespace object fixed to return correct field values in API responses. We now use PGSQL based insert/update/delete feature operations.
  - Fixed Sequencer module to skip external connectors that don't have DB credentials to perform sequencing
  - Fixed Publisher module to skip SNS message attribute where it is found as empty string in message event
  - Fixed `handle` value in Iterate API response to support subsequent iterate operations using previous `handle` as offset
  - Event Publisher `fetch-newer-transactions` query fixed to improve performance (from 10 mins per call to 1 sec) for significantly bigger history table (e.g. 80+ million records or 190+ GB)
